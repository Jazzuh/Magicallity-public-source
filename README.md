# Magicallity source code
Hey everyone! Welcome to the official source code repository of **Magicallity 1.0**. This repository contains _most_ of the source used to create magicallity as some components were very poorly created and better alternatives could be found on the [FiveM forums](https://forum.fivem.net/).

Most of the code provided will work without _many_ problems however there will still be some because this code hasn't been touched in around six months from the time of this being released to the public. For this reason I recommend that you do not use this code to try and run a server but instead use it as a way of seeing how a FiveM C# resource can be strucuted.

# What features will I find?
Most of if not all of the features within the Magicallity live server will be available from this code. This includes:

  * Multi character system with UI and support for deletion
  * Weather and time sync between all clients WITH admin commands to go with it
  * Interaction menu created using the [FiveM-Menu-Framework by GroovyGiantPanda](https://github.com/GroovyGiantPanda/FiveM-Menu-Framework)
  * Custom emote system with support for props
  * Cinematic mode
  * LEO and EMS features
  * Wide range of convars that can be updated in real time
  * A lot of other stuff I probably forgot about
  
Credit to GroovyGiantPanda for the [FiveMRpServerResources repository](https://github.com/GroovyGiantPanda/FiveMRpServerResources) that provided a lot of useful C# snippets that are used throughout this project.

# Enjoy

There is a very high chance this repo will never be updated again so what you see is what you get.

Saying that though I hope this code is useful and/or educational to somebody who looks at it.
